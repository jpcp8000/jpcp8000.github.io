          Hi! I’m Jacob. I’m a student at BYU with a love and passion for all things digital media, with a focus on videography. I started doing videography in my senior year of high school, shooting everything from football to chemistry labs. This class really helped me to realize how much I love videography. Throughout that year I refined my skills, and got selected to make the varsity soccer intro video, which was normally outsourced to freelance videographers in the area. When I started at BYU, I got lucky enough to get hired as a Video Technician for BYU A/V.As a member of that team, we produced all of the video content that goes on the big screens at all BYU Athletic Events. From Men’s Football vs. Utah, to Women’s Volleyball and the NCAA Tournament, I was lucky to have been a part of the team that brings the game to life on the big screen.  I’m 19, and the oldest of 3 kids. I was born in Virginia, but since then, have lived in Utah, New York, Washington, and Iowa. I started at BYU in fall of 2017 and am still undecided on a major. I am a Mental Health advocate and try my best to help others. In my spare time I enjoy gaming with friends, playing/watching hockey, and sleeping.
